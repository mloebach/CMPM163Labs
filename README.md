(phone recording washed out colors, but all four cubes have different values)


Top Cube: The example blue cube made with custom shaders. Rotation and values unchanged.

Left Cube: Cube made from three.js phong material with altered shine and color values. Rotation changed.

Right Cube: Cube made from the three.js phong material example. Color and shine unchanged. Rotation changed.

Bottom Cube: Cube made with custom shaders. New values for uniform added. Rotation changed.

(screen recording)

Top Cube: Fourth Cube. Created as the second cube with a shader. Single tiling. Includes normal map. Unique texture.

Left Cube: First Cube. Created as a cube with basic texture functionality but no normals.

Middle Cube: Second Cube. Created as cube with basic texture functionality and normal map.

Right Cube: Third Cube. Created as first cube with shader. Single tiling. Includes normal map. Unique texture.

Bottom Cube: Fifth Cube. Created to implement multi-tiles on one surface, in this case Four. Solved by using the modulus function to get the remainder of the position (multiplied by however many tiles we need) when divided by 1, to prevent out of bounds colors. Includes shader, normal map, and unique texture.

24a. (max X size) * u = x

24b. (max Y size) * (1 - v) = y

24c. (3,5) = light gray
