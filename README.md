(phone recording washed out colors, but all four cubes have different values)


Top Cube: The example blue cube made with custom shaders. Rotation and values unchanged.

Left Cube: Cube made from three.js phong material with altered shine and color values. Rotation changed.

Right Cube: Cube made from the three.js phong material example. Color and shine unchanged. Rotation changed.

Bottom Cube: Cube made with custom shaders. New values for uniform added. Rotation changed.


**Lab 4:**

Top Cube: Fourth Cube. Created as the second cube with a shader. Single tiling. Includes normal map. Unique texture.

Left Cube: First Cube. Created as a cube with basic texture functionality but no normals.

Middle Cube: Second Cube. Created as cube with basic texture functionality and normal map.

Right Cube: Third Cube. Created as first cube with shader. Single tiling. Includes normal map. Unique texture.

Bottom Cube: Fifth Cube. Created to implement multi-tiles on one surface, in this case four. Includes shader, normal map, and unique texture.

24a. (max X size) * u = x

24b. (max Y size) * (1 - v) = y

24c. (3,5) = light gray
